== Installation ==

1. Upload the `im8-qtranslate-woocommerce` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins` directory on your web server.
2. Activate the plugin through the _Plugins_ menu in WordPress.
3. Go ahead and use shortcodes like `[:en]Product[:de]Produkt[:es]Producto` for almost anything that is visible for your customers (i.e., visible on the front-end).

== Screenshots ==

1. **WooCommerce Attributes page** - Simply use shortcodes for both attribute names and attribute terms.
2. **Front-end example** - Direct comparison of how a single product looks like in English and German.
